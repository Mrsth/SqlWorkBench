What is SQL?
Select statement.
SQL select distinct.
SQL used for filtering the records int the query.

The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.


The SQL ORDER BY Keyword
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

The SQL INSERT INTO Statement
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.

SQL NULL Values
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.
If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.
Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

	IS NULL Syntax
	SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
	IS NOT NULL Syntax
        SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

The SQL UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table. If no where clause in delete statement then all the record in the table will be deleted.
Only all the recored will be deleted but the table will remain.

	UPDATE Syntax
		UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;

The SQL DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

	DELETE Syntax
		DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;


The SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions
	The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.
	The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.

	MIN() Syntax
		SELECT MIN(column_name)FROM table_name WHERE condition;
	MAX() Syntax
		SELECT MAX(column_name)FROM table_name WHERE condition;
